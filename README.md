## Info
* [The problems](https://github.com/leaskn/algo_practice_solutions/2023) the problems I worked on in 2023
* [blind-76](https://github.com/leaskn/algo_practice_solutions/06-2023) are a set of problems with a focus on learning how to apply Data Strucutres and Algos in a more focused manner. 
  * I'm looking to repetitively work on a set of problems (Matrix, Array, Tree, etc..) to fully learn and understand a specific problem set and ultimately master it before moving on to the next.
  * [Depth-first-then-breadth preparation - Tackle one topic at a time - revise materials for a topic, practice a few questions for that topic. After ensuring mastery, move on to the next topic. Repeat for all topics. At the end, practice a variety of questions across all topics. This strategy takes more time than others, so it's recommended if you have more than a month.](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/)
